# Boss Assistant

**An AI assistant that monitors your boss's emails, completes tasks automatically, learns new skills, and gets your approval.**

## What It Does

1. 📧 **Monitors Email** - Watches for emails from boss@example.com
2. 🧠 **Understands Requests** - Parses what your boss is asking for
3. 🤖 **Executes Tasks** - Tries to complete the work automatically
4. 📚 **Learns New Skills** - If it doesn't know how, it figures it out
5. ✅ **Gets Approval** - Shows you the work before sending/finalizing

## Features

### Email Monitoring
- Checks for new emails every 5 minutes
- Filters by sender (boss@example.com)
- Extracts the request/task from email body

### Task Execution
- Analyzes what needs to be done
- Uses existing skills when available
- Creates new skills for unknown tasks

### Learning System
- When encountering a new type of request, it:
  - Analyzes the task
  - Creates a skill to handle it
  - Saves the skill for future use

### Approval Workflow
- Presents completed work in a GUI
- Shows what was done and why
- You approve, edit, or reject
- Only sends after your approval

## Usage

### Start the Assistant

```bash
python boss_assistant.py --start
```

The assistant will:
1. Connect to your email
2. Monitor for boss emails
3. Process new requests automatically
4. Present results for your approval

### Configuration

Create `.boss_assistant_config.json`:
```json
{
  "email": "your.user@example.com",
  "boss_email": "boss@example.com",
  "check_interval_minutes": 5,
  "auto_reply": false,
  "require_approval": true
}
```
